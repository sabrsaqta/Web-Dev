    <strong>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
    <em>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</em><br>
    Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
    <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
    Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
    Until one day, you walk.<br>
    One foot in front of the other. <strong>One idea on top of the next.</strong><br>
    Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
    Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
    This. is. learning.<br>
    It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
    You just don’t get it, yet.
